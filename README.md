Computational model to simulate competition of synapses for synaptic building blocks

The following explains what figures of the accompanying paper "Competition for synaptic building blocks shapes synaptic plasticity" by Jochen Triesch, Anh Duong Vo, and Anne-Sophie Hafner were made with what program. The code was written by Jochen Triesch and Anh Duong Vo.
